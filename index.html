		<h3>About Me:</h3>

		<img src="greece001.jpg" alt="Santorini">

		<p>I am 28 years old. I have been married for close to 3 years to my wife, Tiffany.<br>We are thrilled to announce that we will be 
		expecting our first child this year on December 7th.
		I recently graduated from Southern Evangelical Seminary with a Bachelor's in Religious Studies.<br>
		<br>For a hobby, I enjoy reading books on theology, philosphy, and history. After I complete the <br> UNCC bootcamp and find a career in the field of software development, I will pursue a Master's 
		in Philosophy so that I may eventually teach it in a classroom setting part-time. 
		<br>I decided to do this bootcamp because I begin studying code last year and, although I learned a lot on my own, I wanted more structure in learning and having the opportunity to ask <br>
		for help. I really enjoy the classroom setting and learning in an environment with other students. </p>
